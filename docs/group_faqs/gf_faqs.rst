Q: What clouds and regions are available?

A: This information is available at the bottom of our `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_. We are always adding more clouds and regions based on demand. If you don't see a region that you need, please get in touch with us by using the `support page in our console <https://console.solace.cloud/support>`_.  If you don't yet have access to our console you can `sign up for free <https://cloud.solace.com/signup/>`_.

Q: Why aren't all of the regions listed on the `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_ available when I'm creating a service?

A: Only certain regions are available when creating a Free service.  Free service regions are marked with an asterisk on our `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_. Even if you're not using a Free service, you may notice that some regions are not available. This is because we list all of the "Available" regions on our website, while only the "Enabled" regions can be used when creating a service.

"Available" regions are those which have been identified as having the IaaS resources that are required to run our messaging services. "Enabled" regions are those in which PubSub+ Cloud infrastructure is installed and ready to create messaging services.

Q: Can I request a region listed on the `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_ to be available when I'm creating a service?

A: Yes, we add regions to PubSub+ Cloud based on customer demand and you can request a region from our Create Service screen.
